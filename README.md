# Spectral-Analysis-Data-Conversion
This brief Python program was created in order to aid statistical analysis within an IMSA Methods in Scientific Inquiry course project. This algorithm takes as input a text file with any amount of spectrophotometer light absorbance values (separated by line, 600nm wavelength). Using these values, it then calculates the concentration of E. coli (using Beer-Lambert’s law) in each sample, as well as each sample’s approximated turbidity. The program finally outputs two text files for concentration and turbidity, each labeled with numbers corresponding to each sample. Each time a spectrophotometer test is conducted, all absorption data points can be saved as a text file from the Vernier Logger Pro application, then directly inputted to the algorithm in order to almost instantly obtain corresponding concentration and turbidity values for further analysis. We found that utilizing this program for data analysis was much more effective than using an application such as Microsoft Excel, which would require manually entering each data point from the spectral analysis application.
